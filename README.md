# Thesis Project on Image Inpainting

This repository contains the essential components of my thesis on evaluating/analysing inpainting models based on Gated Convolutions proposed by Yu et al. (https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting). The Google Drive is structured into several folders, each serving a distinct purpose within the project.

## Folder Structure

### 1. Evaluation
This folder includes:
- **Final Images**: The final images used for inpainting evaluation.
- **Notebooks**:
  - **Pruning**: Notebook for pruning images.
  - **Shrinking Images**: Notebook for resizing images.
  - **Creating Masks**: Notebook for generating masks for each image size.
  - **Testing One Image**: Notebook to test a single image with the model.
  - **Run All Models**: Notebook to execute all (pruned) models on all images with all masks.

### 2. Evaluation Analysis
This folder comprises:
- **CSV Files**: Data files containing results of the inference.
- **Analyses**:
  - **Inpainting Quality Analysis**: Analysis of the quality of the inpainting results.
  - **Efficiency Analysis**: Analysis of efficiency metrics such as memory usage and running time.

### 3. Example App Video
This folder contains a video demonstrating the inpainting application.

### 4. Train
This folder includes Python training files based on the work of Yu et al. (https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting). 

### 5. Inpainting App
This folder contains the files needed to run the inpainting app. Make sure to read all the README files and other markdown files.


## Note
The contents of this drive are subject to change. More details and descriptions will be added over time.
